# Android Calendar content provider usage example.
This is a simple Android project which shows a basic usage of Calendar content provider.
We found the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/calendar-provider.html">Android Developer Guide</a> very useful, but under some points of view a little incomplete or, if you prefer, a little messy. So we decided to share the code of our "scouting" around it.

More explanations coming soon...
